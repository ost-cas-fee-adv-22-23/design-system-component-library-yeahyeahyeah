# Mumble

## Design System Component Library

![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/smartive-education/design-system-component-library-yeahyeahyeah?style=for-the-badge)
[![Star on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/smartive-education/design-system-component-library-yeahyeahyeah.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/smartive-education/design-system-component-library-yeahyeahyeah/)

> Welcome to the Design System Component Library **Mumble**. You will find here all the components that belong to the System Components library and how you can eventually create a **Mumble Twitter clone** with them based on the [Mumble interface system on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/nsXR2h0KwciWpuwKRD58FX/Mumble?node-id=478%3A1054&t=n9WIHrIjnGzWwqTX-0).

The library is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and the Addon [Twin](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro) for Tailwindcss based on [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/). All components are accessible and can be displayed on all devices.

Before you get started, please read and understand our **Mumble guidelines** on [Typography](./?path=/story/guidelines-typography--page), [Colors](./?path=/story/guidelines-colors--page) and finally our [Developer Guidelines](./?path=/story/guidelines-development--page).
